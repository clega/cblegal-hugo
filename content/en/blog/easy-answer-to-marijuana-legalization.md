There is excitement over the upcoming legalization of marijuana. And also some anxiety: will marijuana enter the workplace? What do employers have to do in response to the legalization? 



The easy answer: nothing. By becoming legalized, marijuana loses its special status and it no longer requires a special response from the employers.  



While the employers could just... take it easy... this is a good opportunity to review or create relevant policies of general application. This includes policies about: 

  - intoxication, impairment, being under the influence:  Are there any safety concerns that require  stricter approaches, such as a zero tolerance policy or the administration of tests?
  - disability and accommodation: Are you prepared to accommodate employees who require medical marijuana, or employees who are battling addiction? 
  - health, safety and comfort in the workplace: Do you have adequate smoke-free policies? Are there any scent sensitivities in the workplace, or should you take proactive measures to maintain a scent-free environment?
  - employees' conduct outside the workplace: Are there any special professional or reputational considerations that might be relevant?



Policies are, of course, useful only if they are known and enforced. Employers can provide the employees with copies of the policies, send a mass email, post signs and reminders in conspicuous places, and encourage the employees -- including the supervisors who are supposed to enforce the policies -- to request any clarifications necessary.
