The words "Acts of God" conjure plagues of locusts and lice, and festering boils. But, after six tornadoes blew through the Ottawa area in September 2018, the phrase may also conjure something just as frightening to Ottawa homeowners: the possible denial of insurance benefits.



It is a good time to take out the home insurance policy and review the coverage. 



The policy will likely not speak of "acts of God." The expression is used more commonly in American policies, where it is used to describe unpredictable events, including extreme weather events. 



Canadians prefer the term "perils." It sounds a fair bit less majestic, but also more accurate, as coverage is truly not based on theological reasoning. 



Coverage availability is the result of complex assessments of risk and cost. Some perils are frequent and produce extensive damage, which makes them very expensive to insure. As a result, they are regularly excluded from coverage and are essentially uninsurable.  Other perils are still common enough and expensive enough that they are not automatically included in the basic coverage, but coverage can be purchased as an add-on. Yet other  perils will be covered at no additional cost.



So, what about tornadoes?



Unfortunately, there is no quick logical (or theological) shortcut to determine whether a certain peril is covered or not. To find out whether a specific peril is covered, you have to check your policy, ask your insurer, or ask for legal advice.
